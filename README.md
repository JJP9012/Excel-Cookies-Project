## 🚀 Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of cookie sales across different countries and product categories. The goal was to uncover insights about sales trends, identify the best-selling cookie types, and determine how global and seasonal factors influenced sales performance. The analysis was performed using **Excel** for data cleaning, calculations and interactive data visualizations.

## 🔧 Tools and Techniques

- **Excel**:  
  - 🧹 *Data Cleaning*: Used find and replace to remove manually entered dollar signs, formatted the data, and added a new column called 'Profit_Margin'.  
  - 📊 *Calculations*: Used formulas to calculate the Profit_Margin=[Profit/Cost]*100. I also used sums, averages, and sales percentages.  
  - 🔍 *Filtering*: The slicers and timelines allow the analysis to focus on specific countries, product types, and time periods for deeper analysis.
  - 🖼️ *Data Visualization*: Created interactive charts to visualize trends, sales performance, and global comparisons.
